  In CSS, margins can be a pain to work with. One of the reasons for this
  is that top and bottom margins collapse into one another. For example,
  if you have one paragraph following another and they both have top
  and bottom margins of 1em, the space between them will be... 1em.
  It will not be 2em as you might think. To get around this odd behavior,
  many developers choose to set all margins on paragrph elements to 0
  and fix problems as they arise.

/* UTILITY CLASSES */

/*
  When you get rid of margins, everything is crammed together. For example,
  paragraphs will have no space between them, which is NOT good design.
  The following utility class gives a top margin of 1.25rem (20px)
  to all children inside a parent with class .flow-content,
  EXCEPT for the first child, which will NOT get a margin.
  That's because "elem + elem" means that the rule should be applied
  to the first elem only when it is followed by another elem.
